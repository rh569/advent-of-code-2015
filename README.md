# Advent of Code 2015

## Restrictions

## Setup

Project was setup for use with venv using `python -m venv venv`.

In order for the scripts on each day to be able to import the local modules, they must be run from the project root as modules. For example:

```
(venv) advent-of-code-2015 % python -m 01/main
```
